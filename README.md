Since joining Wells eight months ago, my experience has been incredible. I joined the CRM COE team under Karthik Dupakuntla and learned a new tech stack with the disclaimer that I would be unlocking my potential and pushing my boundaries. I started working in Salesforce and EPL for Salesforce. I have also been involved in AI projects that help me stay on top of new innovations. Since joining, I have been upskilling daily—not just in terms of technical skills but also in building confidence in the direction my life is heading.
In just a few months, I have been able to contribute my skills alongside like-minded people, forming teams, winning hackathons, and working on exciting projects. I feel like I am not constrained to a specific space but have the freedom to explore everything I am passionate about, thanks to Karthik. I am grateful to be in good hands—exploring, learning, and building.
